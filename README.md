# Weather-Notification-System

The goal is to create a simple application where different devices (like a phone app, LED panel, and alarm system) receive real-time updates whenever the weather changes.

Requirements:
WeatherStation acts as the Subject.

Devices (such as PhoneDisplay, LEDDisplay, AlarmSystem) are Observers.

When the temperature changes, the WeatherStation notifies all registered observers automatically.
